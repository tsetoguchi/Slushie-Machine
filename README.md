# The-Slushie-Machine
A multicomponent audio processing application that focuses on maintaining a simplistic UI.

Our goal as producers and developers has been to introduce simplicity and creativity in our plugins. The primary purpose of our project is to create an effects plugin that appeals to a wide demographic of users. We believe that a simple, easy to use plugin will naturally appeal to a wider demo-
graphic. We developed a plugin called The Slushie Machine capable of modifying sound in various ways through the use of multiple effects combined in series. By carefully customizing the parameters, orderings, and algorithms of these effects, we have created our own recipe that is unique to our plugin.
